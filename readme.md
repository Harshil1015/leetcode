# LeetCode DSA Solutions 🚀

Welcome to my repository where I'm consistently solving and uploading **LeetCode** problems to strengthen my **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** skills.

This folder is a part of my daily learning journey as a Master's student in Computer Science, and my goal is to solve problems in different categories and programming languages.

## 📁 Folder Structure

All problems are organized inside the `leetcode/` folder. Each problem typically includes:

- Problem name (same as LeetCode title)
- Solution code
- Language used (mostly Python, Java, C++, etc.)

## 🧠 Topics Covered

- Arrays
- Strings
- Hash Maps & Sets
- Sliding Window
- Two Pointers
- Stack & Queue
- Binary Search
- Recursion & Backtracking
- Trees & Graphs
- Dynamic Programming (DP)

## 🛠 Languages Used

- Python 🐍
- Java ☕
- C++ 💻

## 📅 Progress

I try to commit at least 1 problem daily or a few per week as part of my continuous learning.
